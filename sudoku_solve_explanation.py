Detailed Explanation of the Sudoku Solve Function

The solve function uses a backtracking algorithm, which is a systematic way to try different 
combinations until a valid solution is found. Here's how it works:

=== BACKTRACKING CONCEPT ===

Backtracking is like solving a maze:
1. You try a path
2. If it leads to a dead end, you go back (backtrack)
3. You try a different path
4. Repeat until you find the exit

In Sudoku:
1. Find an empty cell
2. Try placing a number (1-9)
3. If it's valid, move to the next empty cell
4. If you get stuck, go back and try a different number
5. Repeat until the puzzle is solved

Key Points:
- It's a systematic search through all possibilities
- It's guaranteed to find a solution if one exists
- It can be slow for very difficult puzzles
- The recursion depth can be up to the number of empty cells

=== COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS ===

Time Complexity:
- Worst case: O(9^(n)) where n is the number of empty cells
- In practice: Much better due to constraint propagation
- Average case: O(9^(n/2)) for typical puzzles

Space Complexity:
- O(n) where n is the number of empty cells (recursion depth)
- Each recursive call uses constant space for local variables

Optimization Techniques:
1. Most Constrained Variable (MCV): Choose cell with fewest valid options
2. Least Constraining Value (LCV): Try values that eliminate fewest options
3. Forward Checking: Remove invalid values from other cells
4. Arc Consistency: Ensure all constraints are satisfied

The current implementation is basic but effective.
For harder puzzles, advanced techniques like Dancing Links (DLX) are used.
